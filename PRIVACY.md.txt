Privacy Policy
This privacy policy describes how the NOVEYA FDL API and related tools handle information when you use our services.
We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your personal data.
Information We Collect
We collect information solely for the purpose of providing and improving the functionality of the FDL API and related services:
•	User input and responses: We process the text you submit through the API (including examples, prompts, and responses) to generate structured outputs and run function calls.
•	API usage metadata: We log basic metadata (such as timestamps, request IDs, IP addresses, and user agent strings) to monitor performance, debug issues, and ensure service reliability.
•	Authentication data: If you provide API keys or OAuth tokens for integration, we store and use these credentials solely to authenticate your requests. We never store your personal passwords.
We do not collect or process any sensitive personal data (such as health information, political beliefs, or precise location data) unless explicitly provided by you as part of your input.
We do not sell your data to third parties.
How We Use Information
Your information is used in the following ways:
1.	Service delivery: To generate structured outputs, execute functions, and respond to your requests according to your schema definitions.
2.	Service improvement: Aggregated and anonymized metadata may be used to improve our models, refine responses, and enhance system performance.
3.	Security and compliance: We use logs and metadata to detect abuse, monitor for malicious activity, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We only share your information under these circumstances:
•	Service providers: We may share data with trusted service providers who assist in operating our infrastructure (e.g., cloud hosting), under strict confidentiality agreements.
•	Legal requirements: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., courts or government agencies).
•	Safety: To protect the rights, property, or safety of NOVEYA, our users, or the public.
We do not sell, rent, or trade personal information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.
Data Retention
We retain user inputs and metadata only as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
Inputs to the API and generated outputs are stored transiently to fulfill each request, after which they may be retained in backups and logs for up to 30 days before being purged.
Metadata logs may be retained for up to 90 days to assist with troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
Security Measures
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These include:
•	Encryption in transit (TLS) for all API requests.
•	Access controls and authentication mechanisms for administrative interfaces.
•	Regular security reviews and vulnerability assessments.
Your Choices
You can:
•	Request deletion: If you wish to have specific data deleted sooner than our normal retention period, please contact us at the email address below.
•	Access and correction: You may request to see or correct the data we hold about you.
•	Limit information: You can minimize the data we collect by avoiding personal information in your inputs.
Updates to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on our website and updating the effective date.
